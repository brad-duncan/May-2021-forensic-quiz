This is a github repository for the Internet Storm Center (ISC) May 2021 Forensic Contest.  The contest is located here: https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/May+2021+Forensic+Contest/27386/

Password for the zip archive in this repository is: infected

Of note, the pcap from this repository contains actual Windows-based malware within the traffic.  That poses a risk of infection when reviewing the pcap on a Windows-based host.  I reccomend people review the pcap in a non-Windows environment.
